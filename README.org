* MSP430 Projects
** Updated 2017-10-08

This repository will document development of MSP430 projects using `MSP430-GCC` and `mspdebug`.

This [document](http://www.phas.ubc.ca/~michal/phys319/tools_install-linux.pdf) has been very very helpful to get the workflow and tools setup in Linux:


** General Workflow

1. Follow the Makefile in `cblink`

$ cd examples/cblink
$ make

2. Enter `mspdebug`

$ mspdebug rf2500

3. Deploy to the MSP430

$ prog main.elf

CTRL+D

** Active Projects

*** Bike Generator Diagnostics System

This project will use an MSP430 to read a current sensor, bicycle tachometer, and send serial data to some other device, like a laptop or Raspberry Pi.  Initially, the data will be read by a Python application and plotted using Plotly in a Jupyter notebook.
